# Early Detection of Tomato Leaf Detection is a major necessity in a growing Tomato plants
#It is necessary that leaf diseases in plants are detected at a very early stage and predictive mechanisms to be adopted to make them safe and avoid losses to the agri-based economy.
#This code proposes to identify the Tomato Plant Leaf disease using image processing techniques based on Image segmentation, clustering, and open-source algorithms.
# Thus all contributing to a reliable, safe, and accurate system of leaf disease with the specialization to Tomato Plants.
